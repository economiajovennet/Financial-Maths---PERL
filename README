Some financial maths scripts made in PERL by EconomiaJoven.net

We're going to improve the existing scripts and adding new ones.
Most operations in the scripts are recurrent, so they are only explained once.

If you need further explanations, we suggest you to check either a financial maths book or a PERL book.
(Do not get us wrong, this advice is probably highly useful for us, too)
